To run:
	python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000

The backend is in the backend/ folder. It is recommended to make a copy of it on a cluster node (helios or mist) 
to take advantage of the node computing power. To do so:
	scp -r backend/ your_username@helios.public.stolaf.edu:dcor_backend

Then you need to change this constants in the views.py file:
	BACKEND_SERVER_LOCATION = 'guillet@helios.public.stolaf.edu'
	BACKEND_FOLDER_NAME     = 'dcor_backend'
