<h1> Welcome to Hipercic </h1> <br/>
<ul><li>Authenticore is the administrative site for the HiPerCiC interface. This is where users can be added, changed, and removed from the system.  </li>
<li>Groups are for adding permissions to many users.  When you create a user, simply add a group to the user and all the permissions added to the group will affect the user.  Note: removing a permission from a group will remove that permissions from all users in the group. </li>
<li>We, as the developers, would like suggestions for the content of this site. Please fell free to make suggestions below.</li>
