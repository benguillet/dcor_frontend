----------------------------------- docGen Project -------------------------------------
The docGen package generates documentation for python modules using the pydoc 
documentation tool, which is included in releases of Python.  However, pydoc does
not provide advanced functionality nor support for packages where the modules rely
on external imports, such as the Django framework.  The docGen package extends the
functionality of pydoc to make it useful in these scenarios.

docGen is capable of generating a full pydoc website for a set of nested python
packages, and also of creating a Django-ready urlconfig file allowing the pydoc site
to be integrated into existing Django web templates.

Revision History:

0.1.0 - Initial version.  Some debugging needed, some TODO's still in the code.





----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Files included (0.1.0) :

__init__.py -- Makes the directory a python package.  Holds a definition for which modules to import with the from... import * statement.
main.py -- The main() function for the docGen application.  Controls argument parsing and flow of the program.
docGen -- An executable python script which calls main() when it is run.  This is the executable for the project.
src/out.py -- Output writing utilities, including log(), debugPrint() and a method to generate Django urlConfig files for documentation websites.
src/importer.py -- A method for explicit importing of python modules.  The built-in method __import__(moduleName) doesn't provide enough functionality for importing a module nested inside several packages, so the importModule method provides better performance for importing single modules.
src/doc.py -- Calls the pydoc package to generate documentation for python modules.  Pydoc only generates in the current working directory and cannot be customized, so
src/core.py -- Contains methods describing the major steps in the execution of docGen.  Includes a configuration function, a documentation generation function, and a Django urlconfig writing function.
